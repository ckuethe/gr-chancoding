 * \brief Reed-Muller(-Golay) Soft-Decision-Decoder
 *
 * Decodes a codeword with a length of 2^m bits from the vector of floats at the input.
 * The floats have to be in the range (0,1). Each floats includes information on the reliability of the corresponding bit.    
 * The 1 + \p m + \p num_bits_precoded decoded bits are bitwise put into a vector of integers, starting with the LSB of the first element.
 * 
 * The algorithm used is based on the method of supercode decoding (modified version of algorithm 17 introduced in  DAVIS , J.A. and J. JEDWAB: "Peak-to-mean power control in OFDM, Golay comple-
 * mentary sequences, and Reed-Muller codes". Information Theory, IEEE Transactions
 * on, 45(7):2397 â€“2417, November 1999.)
 *
 * \param num_bits_precoded How many bits were used to select the golay-coset?
 * \param m Parameter for the length of the Reed-Muller Code (RM(r,m))
 *
 * \ingroup chancoding
